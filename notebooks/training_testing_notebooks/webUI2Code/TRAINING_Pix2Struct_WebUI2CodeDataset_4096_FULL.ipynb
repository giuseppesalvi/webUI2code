We have 4 lakes that are stocked regularly with trout supplied by Bristol Water. These are superb quality fish. We also have six miles of fly fishing on the river Chew, with stretches of the upper Yeo. Whilst using worm at certain times of year is allowed on the Chew, the vast majority of members only use the fly. There is usually a good mayfly hatch on the Chew and there is a good head of both wild brown trout and stocked rainbows all of which will rise to dry flies in the right conditions.</p> <p>With our combination of waters we offer fishing 365 days a year. Two fish per day can be kept although many members now prefer catch and release.</p> <p>Knowle Angling is excellent value with annual membership at only 200 per annum for under 65s and 185 for over 65s. We offer junior membership at 45 and members can bring a guest for 20 per day. As some of our older members have recently retired from the club, we are looking for new members, with a small 5 joining fee.</p> <p>All of our waters are set in the beautiful countryside of the Chew and Yeo valleys, with Pensford, Chew Magna and Chew Stoke the key local towns.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <br/> </div> </div> <div class=\"right_container\"> <div class=\"right_link\">Link</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Links to other <br/> helpfull websites </a> <br/> <br/> <div class=\"right_link\">Rules</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Read about <br/> Membership Rules </a> <br/> <br/> <div class=\"right_link\">Facebook</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Join our <br/> Facebook Group </a> </div> </div> <div class=\"footer\"> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Membership</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Privacy Policy</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">News</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Downloads</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Articles</a> <br/> <span class=\"copyrights\"> Copyright 2023 Knowle Bristol Angling Association Limited</span> </div> </div> </body> </html> /* START CSS */ body { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #1a2c5e; margin: 0; background-color: #FFFFFF; } a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #1a2c5e; text-decoration: underline; }.page_container { width: 993px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; }.top { width: 93%; float: left; height: 16px; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 10px; color: #FFFFFF; padding-left: 89px; padding-top: 2px; }.header { width: 917px; height: 321px; float: right; padding-top: 11px; }.tab_container { width: 100%; float: left; height: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 3px; }.tab:link { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.on { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.page { width: 100%; float: left; height: auto; background-color: #FFFFFF; min-height: 661px; }.pictures_container { width: 153px; height: auto; float: left; margin-left: 30px; text-align: center; padding-left: 32px; }.img { width: 140px; height: 106px; float: left; border: 5px solid #c9c7c7; margin-bottom: 8px; }.right_container { width: 111px; height: auto; float: right; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center; }.right_link { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1a2c5e; height: 19px; width: 100%; text-align: center; padding-top: 4px; float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; }.middle_section { width: 563px; height: auto; float: left; margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 30px; }.heading { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #1a2c5e; }.footer { width: 100%; float: left; height: 61px; text-align: center; color: #FFFFFF; font-weight: normal; padding-top: 8px; }.footer a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.footer a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.copyrights { color: #4f5d83; }\n",

We have 4 lakes that are stocked regularly with trout supplied by Bristol Water. These are superb quality fish. We also have six miles of fly fishing on the river Chew, with stretches of the upper Yeo. Whilst using worm at certain times of year is allowed on the Chew, the vast majority of members only use the fly. There is usually a good mayfly hatch on the Chew and there is a good head of both wild brown trout and stocked rainbows all of which will rise to dry flies in the right conditions.</p> <p>With our combination of waters we offer fishing 365 days a year. Two fish per day can be kept although many members now prefer catch and release.</p> <p>Knowle Angling is excellent value with annual membership at only 200 per annum for under 65s and 185 for over 65s. We offer junior membership at 45 and members can bring a guest for 20 per day. As some of our older members have recently retired from the club, we are looking for new members, with a small 5 joining fee.</p> <p>All of our waters are set in the beautiful countryside of the Chew and Yeo valleys, with Pensford, Chew Magna and Chew Stoke the key local towns.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <br/> </div> </div> <div class=\"right_container\"> <div class=\"right_link\">Link</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Links to other <br/> helpfull websites </a> <br/> <br/> <div class=\"right_link\">Rules</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Read about <br/> Membership Rules </a> <br/> <br/> <div class=\"right_link\">Facebook</div> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"><img src=\"../../images/default_img.jpeg\"/></a> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://example.com\"> Join our <br/> Facebook Group </a> </div> </div> <div class=\"footer\"> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Membership</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Privacy Policy</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">News</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Downloads</a> <a href=\"https://example.com\">Articles</a> <br/> <span class=\"copyrights\"> Copyright 2023 Knowle Bristol Angling Association Limited</span> </div> </div> </body> </html> /* START CSS */ body { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #1a2c5e; margin: 0; background-color: #FFFFFF; } a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #1a2c5e; text-decoration: underline; }.page_container { width: 993px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; }.top { width: 93%; float: left; height: 16px; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 10px; color: #FFFFFF; padding-left: 89px; padding-top: 2px; }.header { width: 917px; height: 321px; float: right; padding-top: 11px; }.tab_container { width: 100%; float: left; height: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 3px; }.tab:link { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.on { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.page { width: 100%; float: left; height: auto; background-color: #FFFFFF; min-height: 661px; }.pictures_container { width: 153px; height: auto; float: left; margin-left: 30px; text-align: center; padding-left: 32px; }.img { width: 140px; height: 106px; float: left; border: 5px solid #c9c7c7; margin-bottom: 8px; }.right_container { width: 111px; height: auto; float: right; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center; }.right_link { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1a2c5e; height: 19px; width: 100%; text-align: center; padding-top: 4px; float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; }.middle_section { width: 563px; height: auto; float: left; margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 30px; }.heading { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #1a2c5e; }.footer { width: 100%; float: left; height: 61px; text-align: center; color: #FFFFFF; font-weight: normal; padding-top: 8px; }.footer a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.footer a { font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; }.copyrights { color: #4f5d83; }\n",
